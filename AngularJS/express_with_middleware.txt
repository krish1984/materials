What is Express & Middleware 
----------------------------
Express.js is a lightweight HTTP framework for node.js that allows you to create a variety of applications, from a standard website to a REST API. It gets out of your way with a minimal API that you fill in with your custom needs.

An Express application is essentially a series of middleware function calls.The structure of ExpressJS is this: everything is “middleware”.  Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.

Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

Execute any code.
Make changes to the request and the response objects.
End the request-response cycle.
Call the next middleware function in the stack.
If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.

An Express application can use the following types of middleware:

Application-level middleware
Router-level middleware
Error-handling middleware
Built-in middleware
Third-party middleware

Application-level middleware
Bind application-level middleware to an instance of the app object by using the app.use().This example shows a middleware function with no mount path. The function is executed every time the app receives a request.

var app = express()
app.use(function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('Time:', Date.now())
  next()
})
This example shows a middleware function mounted on the /user/:id path. The function is executed for any type of HTTP request on the /user/:id path.

app.use('/user/:id', function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('Request Type:', req.method)
  next()
})

You can also chain middlewares as follows:
app.use('/user/:id', function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('Request URL:', req.originalUrl)
  next()
}, function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('Request Type:', req.method)
  next()
})

Router-level middleware
Router-level middleware works in the same way as application-level middleware, except it is bound to an instance of express.Router().

var app = express()
var router = express.Router()
// a middleware function with no mount path. This code is executed for every request to the router
router.use(function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('Time:', Date.now())
  next()
})

// a middleware sub-stack shows request info for any type of HTTP request to the /user/:id path
router.use('/user/:id', function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('Request URL:', req.originalUrl)
  next()
}, function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('Request Type:', req.method)
  next()
})

// a middleware sub-stack that handles GET requests to the /user/:id path
router.get('/user/:id', function (req, res, next) {
  // if the user ID is 0, skip to the next router
  if (req.params.id === '0') next('route')
  // otherwise pass control to the next middleware function in this stack
  else next()
}, function (req, res, next) {
  // render a regular page
  res.render('regular')
})

// handler for the /user/:id path, which renders a special page
router.get('/user/:id', function (req, res, next) {
  console.log(req.params.id)
  res.render('special')
})

// mount the router on the app
app.use('/', router)

Error-handling middleware
Error-handling middleware always takes four arguments. You must provide four arguments to identify it as an error-handling middleware function. Even if you don’t need to use the next object, you must specify it to maintain the signature. Otherwise, the next object will be interpreted as regular middleware and will fail to handle errors.

app.use(function (err, req, res, next) {
  console.error(err.stack)
  res.status(500).send('Something broke!')
})

Built-in middleware
The only built-in middleware function in Express is express.static.
You can have more than one static directory per app:

app.use(express.static('public'))
app.use(express.static('uploads'))
app.use(express.static('files'))

Third-party middleware
Use third-party middleware to add functionality to Express apps.
Ex: 
app.use(bodyParser())
app.use(cookieParser())
Ex:
var express = require('express')
var app = express()
var cookieParser = require('cookie-parser')
// load the cookie-parsing middleware
app.use(cookieParser())


Default Express 4.0 middlewares
-------------------------------------------
morgan: logger
body-parser: parse the body so you can access parameters in requests in req.body. e.g. req.body.name.
cookie-parser: parse the cookies so you can access parameters in cookies req.cookies. e.g. req.cookies.name.
serve-favicon: exactly that, serve favicon from route /favicon.ico. Should be call on the top before any other routing/middleware takes place to avoids unnecessary parsing.

Other ExpressJS Middlewares
----------------------------------------
The following middlewares are not added by default, but it’s nice to know they exist at least:

compression: compress all request. e.g. app.use(compression())

session: create sessions. e.g. app.use(session({secret: 'Secr3t'}))

method-override: app.use(methodOverride('_method')) Override methods to the one specified on the _method param. e.g. GET /resource/1?_method=DELETE will become DELETE /resource/1.

response-time: app.use(responseTime()) adds X-Response-Time header to responses.

errorhandler: Aid development, by sending full error stack traces to the client when an error occurs. app.use(errorhandler()). It is good practice to surround it with an if statement to check process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'.

vhost: Allows you to use different stack of middlewares depending on the request hostname. e.g. app.use(vhost('*.user.local', userapp)) and app.use(vhost('assets-*.example.com', staticapp)) where userapp and staticapp are different express instances with different middlewares.

csurf: Adds a Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection by adding a token to responds either via session or cookie-parser middleware. app.use(csrf());
