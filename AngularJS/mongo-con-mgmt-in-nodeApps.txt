Connection Mgmt:
-------------------------
What is the right way to deal with Mongodb connections?
A: Since Node.js is single threaded you shouldn't be opening and closing the connection on each request (like you would do in other multi-threaded environments.)

This is a quote from the person that wrote the MongoDB node.js client module:
“You open do MongoClient.connect once when your app boots up and reuse the db object. It's not a singleton connection pool each .connect creates a new connection pool. So open it once an[d] reuse across all requests.” - christkv
