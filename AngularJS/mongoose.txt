What is _version field in mongo created by mongoose?
------------------------------------------------------
The versionKey is a property set on each document when first created by Mongoose by default.

The version key is also retrived for each record when queried, which is ugly. 
This keys value contains the internal revision of the document. The name of this document property is configurable. The default is __v.

If this conflicts with your application you can configure as such: new Schema({..}, { versionKey: '_somethingElse' })

If you don't need version_key, you can just:

var UserSchema = mongoose.Schema({
    nickname: String,
    reg_time: {type: Date, default: Date.now}
}, {
    versionKey: false // You should be aware of the outcome after set to false
});

To hide it from all queries, which sometimes can be not what you want too, use the select schema type option:
var Schema = new Schema({ __v: { type: Number, select: false}}) 
});

or  you can call user.toObject({ versionKey: false }), which will hide __v version property or when you query, like model.findById(id).select('-__v')
'-' means exclude the field.
