1. curl -O https://fastdl.mongodb.org/linux/mongodb-linux-x86_64-3.4.7.tgz
2.tar -zxvf mongodb-linux-x86_64-3.4.7.tgz
3. Using winscp rename the extracted folder to "mongodb"
4. Ensure the location of the binaries is in the PATH variable.
 export PATH=/home/ec2-user/mongodb/bin:$PATH
5. Bydefault mongo looks for the data directory at root/data/db. So create it: mkdir -p /data/db
6. Set write permissions for the data directory so that mongo can read/write data into it.
sudo chmod -R go+w /data/db: which will make the directory writable by everyone:
sudo chown -R $USER /data/db: which will make the directory writable only by you 

or combine 5&6 with : "sudo mkdir -p /data/db" and "sudo chown -R 'username' /data/db"

7. Now from the "bin" directory type: mongod

8. Now check if mongod is running using : ps -ax | grep mongo
9. kill mongod say:  kill -9 <pid>


10. Note that every time you logoff from putty, mongod will be terminated and also the path you exported is alos gone.

9. To make sure mongod starts in background follow this text:

The MongoDB daemon (mongod) has a command-line option to run the server in the background...: --fork
This command-line option requires that you also specify a file to log messages to (since it can not use the current console). 
An example of this command looks like:

mongod --fork --logpath /var/log/mongod.log
You could put this into an /etc/init.d/mongod bash script file. And then to have the service run at startup, create the standard 
symbolic links (S## & K##) inside of /etc/rc#.d/. Here is a tutorial (http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/LinuxTutorialInitProcess.html)
that explains this process in more detail. Scroll down to the section 
titled "Init Script Activation". This also has the added benefit of being able to execute commands like...

service mongod status
service mongod start
service mongod stop


10. Connecting to the mongo using Robomongo from your Local machine:

Make sure you create Inbound rule to allow any machine to connect to your machine by following the link:
