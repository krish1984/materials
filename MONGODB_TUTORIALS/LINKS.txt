 Isolation does not occur on multiple documents, there is an $isolated ( http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/operator/isolated/ ) operator but it is highly recommened not to use it, plus it isn't supported on sharded collections.

Mapreduce vs aggregate
https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.4/core/map-reduce-sharded-collections/
https://runnable.com/blog/pipelines-vs-map-reduce-to-speed-up-data-aggregation-in-mongodb
More detailed answer: I am using the aggregation framework in anger on a large project (hasn't released yet, and I can't go into any specifics) that is handling lots of data. Interestingly, a previous prototype of the project (somewhat different functionality, written in a different way by a completely different team) did use map reduce for data transformation purposes.

Performance wise, the aggregation framework won hands down. There's a lot of reasons why, but here are (IMO) the three biggest reasons:

1. With map reduce, you generally output to a collection (often a temporary collection). The aggregation framework is much better suited to return data directly to a calling library when that's what you actually want to do.

2. Map reduce is single threaded, per-server. A mongod instance can only run one map reduce query at a time, whereas the aggregation framework can run multiple operations at once.

3. The aggregation framework can use indexes to reduce the cost of operations where you're only interested in a subset of the contents of a collection.

For us. the combination of these three gave the aggregation framework a huge performance advantage of map reduce for similar (but not identical) problems.

In your case, things might be different, but I'd go so far as to say that the aggregation framework should be everybody's default choice for batch/data processing jobs on MongoDB (well, either AF or application code, I suppose). The list of things that map reduce is best at on this platform is quite small, and getting smaller all of the time.
