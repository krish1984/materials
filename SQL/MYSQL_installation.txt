1. Downlaod MYSQL portable zip version (Windows (x86, 64-bit), ZIP Archive) for windows from : https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/
   and unzip into ur favouite directory. Now create a directory called "data" in the root directory of mysql installation; this will be used
   as the data directory by mysql. This step is mandatory or else mysqld will throw error saying that data directory does't exist.
   By default, mysqld thinks that the data directory name is "data". You can chnage it to any name and to point to any other location by
   changing the "my-default.ini" file as follows:
    # basedir = .....
	# datadir = .....
	# port = .....
	# server_id = .....
	As you can see you can also change the port number on which mysqld should run!

2. Now, Got to the bin directory and execute the command "mysqld.exe --initialize"

3. From the same bin directory execute "mysqld.exe --console". This starts up msql server.

4. Now from the same bin directory execute "mysql -u -root"
   It prompts you for the password, the password is actually generated by the mysqld when you started it in step1 in the data directory with
   the file name "current_loggedin_windows_username.ERR". Open that file and look for a line that says something like this: 
   
   "2017-07-27T17:42:31.149585Z 1 [Note] A temporary password is generated for root@localhost: H.f;)cgw>0rM"
   Copy that password and paste in the password prompt by mysql client cmd window.
   That's it you are now logged in to mysql.

5. Before you do any action, mysql prompts you to change that dirty password autogenerated by mysql:
   so, change it with the command : mysql> ALTER USER root@localhost identified by "MYDAD@14".Once this is doen you can do all the regular db queries..etc.
   
6. mysql> show databases;
	+--------------------+
	| Database           |
	+--------------------+
	| information_schema |
	| mysql              |
	| performance_schema |
	| sys                |
	+--------------------+
	4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
	
7. See all the users in the DB.
	mysql> SELECT * FROM mysql.user;
	+-----------+-----------+
	| User      | Host      |
	+-----------+-----------+
	| mysql.sys | localhost |
	| root      | localhost |
	+-----------+-----------+
	2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

8. Create a user called "username" with "password":
   >GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
   
9. Create a database: CREATE DATABASE book_store;  (Yes, the name should be without quotes "")
10. Use the new ly created database: use book_store;
11. Create table: 
     DROP TABLE IF EXISTS books;
	CREATE TABLE  books (
		id INT(10) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
		title VARCHAR(100),
		author VARCHAR(100),
		subject VARCHAR(100),
		publisher VARCHAR(100), 
		PRIMARY KEY (id)
	);
	
	Yet another table:
	CREATE TABLE  popualation (
		zip_code INT(10) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
		area VARCHAR(100),
		city VARCHAR(100),
		state VARCHAR(100),
		population INT(10),
		PRIMARY KEY (zip_code)
	);
	insert into popualation (area,city,state,population) values ('Begumpet','HYD','TELANGANA',23422 );
	insert into popualation (area,city,state,population) values ('Nizampet', 'HYD', 'TELANGANA',123345 );
	insert into popualation (area,city,state,population) values ('HitechCity','HYD','TELANGANA',56567 );
	insert into popualation (area,city,state,population) values ('Madhapur', 'HYD', 'TELANGANA',4566 );

	insert into popualation (area,city,state,population) values ('WR1','WARANGAL','TELANGANA',3455 );
	insert into popualation (area,city,state,population) values ('WR2', 'WARANGAL', 'TELANGANA',2345 );
	insert into popualation (area,city,state,population) values ('WR3','WARANGAL','TELANGANA',678 );
	insert into popualation (area,city,state,population) values ('WR4', 'WARANGAL', 'TELANGANA',988 );

	insert into popualation (area,city,state,population) values ('SINGNAGAR','BZA','ANDHRA',3455 );
	insert into popualation (area,city,state,population) values ('AUTONAGAR', 'BZA', 'ANDHRA',688 );
	insert into popualation (area,city,state,population) values ('BZCIRCLE','BZA','ANDHRA',345678 );
	insert into popualation (area,city,state,population) values ('PAYAKPURAM', 'BZA', 'ANDHRA',688 );

	insert into popualation (area,city,state,population) values ('LAKSHIMIPURAM','GUNTUR','ANDHRA',8789 );
	insert into popualation (area,city,state,population) values ('KOTHAPET', 'GUNTUR', 'ANDHRA',567 );
	insert into popualation (area,city,state,population) values ('ZINNATOWER','GUNTUR','ANDHRA',345678 );
	insert into popualation (area,city,state,population) values ('BUSSTAND', 'GUNTUR', 'ANDHRA',757 );
	
12. Now you can download Toad for Mysql from online and start querying your beatiful SQL database!

select state,sum(size)  from popualation p group by state, size;

select state,city,size  from popualation p group by city,state,size;


select state,avg(size)  from popualation p group by state,city
