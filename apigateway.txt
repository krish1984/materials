Need of API gateway:
------------------------

We want to expose our indivual services to the public N/W, thera are no of concerns in it:

1. We shud not directly expose the API to public, we need some wall in between which authenticates the external clients.
2. When a client is dependent on multiple services, it wud need to make multiple trips.
3. There can be multiple dissimilar clients calling the same API, but each having diffrent needs some want to assemble multiple calls, some dont want.

So we need somthing in between, that takes care of all of these issues. So API gateway(zuul),

1. provides a single point of contact to our system, takes care of authentication of requests to services.
2. cater neepds of different types of clients, by assembling multiple requests into one call based on clients needs.
3. accept requests and route them to appropriate services(aka reverse proxyig).
4. Cache data to reduce load on services when needed.
