Spring Cloud provides tools for developers to quickly build some of the common patterns in distributed systems 
(e.g. configuration management, service discovery, circuit breakers, intelligent routing, micro-proxy, control bus, one-time tokens, 
global locks, leadership election, distributed sessions, cluster state). 
Spring Cloud allows developers to quickly implement these boiler plate patterns and stand up services.
